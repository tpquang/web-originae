                Originae — Terms of Service (TOS)
              </h1>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">Last Updated: Dec 8th, 2025</p>

              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) form a binding
                agreement between you (&ldquo;Client&rdquo;, &ldquo;User&rdquo;,
                or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) and Originae (&ldquo;Originae&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;). By
                accessing or using any of Originae&rsquo;s services, you confirm
                that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If
                you do not agree, you may not use the Services.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">1. Nature of Services</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                Originae provides execution-focused services across business
                development, marketing, operations, and product &amp;
                technology. We assemble specialist teams, manage delivery
                end-to-end, and operate under engagement models such as
                Fixed-Scope Mandates, Ongoing Managed Mandates, and Pilot or
                MVP-first engagements. Originae is not a staffing agency,
                employer of record, or freelance marketplace; we act as an
                execution partner responsible for delivering the agreed scope of
                work.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                2. Account Access and Client Responsibilities
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                To work with Originae, you may be required to create an account
                or appoint a primary point of contact. You agree to provide
                accurate and updated information, to safeguard your login
                credentials, and to ensure that anyone acting on your behalf
                complies with these Terms. Actions taken by your designated
                representatives are considered authorized and binding on you.
                Originae may suspend or terminate access if account details are
                inaccurate, misused, or associated with a breach of these Terms.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                3. Scope, Delivery and Adjustments
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                Each engagement is governed by a written Scope of Work (SOW),
                Mandate Agreement, or Proposal that outlines deliverables,
                timelines, responsibilities, and fees. This document takes
                precedence over these Terms where contradictions arise.
                Execution timelines depend on the Client’s responsiveness,
                clarity of instructions, and access to required information or
                assets. Originae is not responsible for delays caused by
                incomplete inputs, slow approvals, shifting requirements, or
                third-party dependencies. If the Client requests changes or
                additions to the agreed scope, such adjustments must be mutually
                confirmed in writing and may require additional fees. Originae
                retains full control over its internal processes, team
                assignments, tools, and execution methodologies.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                4. Content and Intellectual Property
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                &ldquo;Client Content&rdquo; refers to materials, data,
                documents, creative assets, and instructions provided to
                Originae. You warrant that you hold all necessary rights to this
                content and that its use by Originae will not violate any
                third-party rights. Originae retains ownership of its internal
                methodologies, frameworks, templates, automations, code
                snippets, processes, and tools, even if used in the delivery of
                Client work. Deliverables specifically created for the Client
                become the Client&rsquo;s property once all due payments have
                been made. Originae may, however, retain the right to reuse
                generalized learnings, anonymized examples, or non-identifying
                versions of deliverables for internal improvement or portfolio
                purposes unless otherwise agreed.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">5. Confidentiality</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                Both parties agree to protect non-public information shared
                during the engagement and to use such information solely for
                purposes related to the Services. Confidentiality obligations do
                not apply to information already public, independently
                developed, obtained lawfully from a third party, or required to
                be disclosed by law.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                6. Fees, Payments, and Refunds
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                All fees, invoicing schedules, and payment terms are defined
                within the SOW or Mandate Agreement. Payments are non-refundable
                unless explicitly stated otherwise. Late or missing payments may
                result in delayed work, suspension of services, or termination
                of the engagement. Chargebacks or disputed payments without
                first contacting Originae constitute a breach of these Terms and
                may result in immediate suspension.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">7. Client Obligations</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                Successful execution depends on your timely cooperation. You
                agree to provide necessary information, tools, access,
                approvals, assets, and feedback in a reasonable timeframe.
                Originae is not responsible for missed objectives or timeline
                slippage resulting from Client-side delays, internal
                coordination issues, or unavailable stakeholders.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">8. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                You may not misuse Originae&rsquo;s services, processes, or
                materials; misrepresent your identity; reverse-engineer or
                replicate proprietary frameworks; solicit or attempt to hire
                Originae personnel without consent; or use the Services for
                unlawful purposes. Activities intended to extract internal
                know-how or circumvent Originae&rsquo;s engagement structure are
                strictly prohibited.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                9. Release and Indemnification
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                You understand that Originae provides execution services, not
                guaranteed business outcomes. You agree to release and indemnify
                Originae from any claims arising out of decisions you make based
                on deliverables, delays caused by Client-side factors, misuse of
                materials, or actions of third-party tools and integrations.
                Originae is not liable for results such as revenue growth, user
                acquisition performance, partnership outcomes, or market impact
                unless otherwise explicitly stated in writing.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                10. Term, Termination, and Cancellation
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                These Terms apply for the duration of your use of the Services.
                You may terminate an Ongoing Mandate with written notice as
                specified in the SOW (typically 30 days). Fixed-scope and Pilot
                engagements are not cancellable once initiated unless mutually
                agreed. Upon termination, all outstanding fees become
                immediately payable. Originae may terminate the engagement
                without notice if payment is not received, if you breach the
                Terms, or if your conduct poses unreasonable risk, obstruction,
                or harm to the engagement or our team.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Originae shall not be
                liable for indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or
                consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of
                revenue, opportunity, profits, or data. Originae&rsquo;s total
                liability under these Terms shall not exceed the fees paid by
                the Client in the preceding three months.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">12. Updates to Terms</h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                Originae may update or modify these Terms at any time. Material
                updates will be communicated to active Clients. Continued use of
                the Services after an update constitutes acceptance of the
                revised Terms.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-heading text-32">
                13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
              </h2>
              <p class="font-base text-24 mb-16">
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed according to the
                laws of Singapore unless otherwise specified in the SOW. Before
                pursuing arbitration or legal action, both parties agree to
                attempt to resolve disputes informally for at least 30 days. If
                unresolved, disputes will be handled through binding arbitration
                conducted in Singapore or via virtual proceedings. Class actions
                or representative claims are not permitted.

                marketing, operations, and product &amp; technology. We assemble
                specialist teams, manage delivery end-to-end, and operate as a
                single accountable execution layer that supports your business
                in moving faster. We are not a traditional agency, staffing
                company, or freelancer marketplace. Our role is to provide
                structured, high-quality execution capabilities, enabling
                organizations to address bandwidth constraints and move critical
                work from idea to completion.
